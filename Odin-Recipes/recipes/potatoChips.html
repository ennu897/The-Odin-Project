    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long! A food processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for slicing the potatoes. Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner. I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced paper-thin</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Transfer potato slices to a large bowl of cold water as you slice them.</li>
        <li>Drain slices and rinse under cold water. Refill the bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons salt, and put slices back in the bowl. Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Working in small batches, fry potato slices until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Continue until all of the slices are fried.</li>
        <li>Season potato chips with additional salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
